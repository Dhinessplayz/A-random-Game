# A-random-Game
This is the time where i invest all my knowledge into one single game and see how it goes.


Here is how the game goes 

when the player wakes up they have a tattoo on their left arm

at the start the player will be put to fight a "blurry creature" and have 1 hp with 1 hit killing them

if they win they gain 1hp to their max health

the "voices" are used as your identity and you can switch between them every time an option comes along

the "scientist" will be bias and reward you to go with their action, some of your voice will agree some wont

there are multiple endings all connecting to "was it worth it""was what you did right?", there is also a pacifist ending the true ending but the hardest- this voice is silent untill the end where it says in an angelic voice "in a cave of darkness you are the bioluminesence that glows" "welcome back honey its been too long" - the players mother, everything about the player is fixed and back to normal but the tattoo is still there

internal dialogue- multiple voices

cannot remember anything before the incident and will make "fake memories" having to trust the "scientist" for context-which will be correct

you can choose witch voice you listen to

there are no restrictions to what you can do

damage to the players frontal cortex

relies on instincts 

vision of the world is blurry

others look humanoid but not just right

trust-some will kill you some will save you but at what cost

labarotory

other "subjects" will be placed in to your cell and you decide your options- assisted by your voices, will they kill you or help you

the "player" has no empathy and relies on the voices, the person playing decides the path they are going to take and which identity they will take on

_**The whole of the list was once the intellectual property of Kevin Muresan now transferred under my jurisdiction**_




This game is completely open for any points you have on it as this is the first time im implementing multiple programming languages for a single project :)
